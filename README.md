# Hospital-Management-System-DMBS
A Hospital Management System designed as a part of a Database Management System (DBMS) project, developed to streamline the operations of hospitals including patient management, doctor scheduling, appointments, billing, and medical records using MySQL and SQL queries.

This project is a web-based Hospital Management System developed using PHP and MySQL, created as part of a Database Management System (DBMS) academic project. The primary goal of this system is to manage hospital operations efficiently and digitally. It streamlines the management of patient details, doctor information, appointment scheduling, billing, and medical records, ensuring better organization and ease of access for both administrative and medical staff.

The system includes modules for handling key entities in a hospital environment. The Patient Management module allows hospital staff to register new patients, update existing records, and view medical history. The Doctor Management module stores and maintains doctor profiles, including their specialization and availability. Using the Appointment module, patients can be scheduled with doctors based on availability, and records of past and upcoming appointments can be easily tracked.

The Billing module is responsible for generating invoices based on the patient's treatment, consultation, and services received. This ensures transparency and maintains a record of financial transactions. Additionally, the system includes a Medical Records section where diagnoses, prescriptions, and treatments can be recorded and retrieved when needed. An admin login feature ensures secure access to the system, restricting unauthorized users.

This project applies several important database concepts, including the design of a relational schema, implementation of SQL queries (DDL, DML), joins, subqueries, stored procedures, triggers, and views. The database is designed following normalization principles (up to 3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. An ER diagram and relational schema were designed as part of the initial planning phase.

The system runs on a local server using XAMPP/WAMP, with phpMyAdmin used for managing the MySQL database. The frontend is created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and the backend is powered by core PHP scripts. The entire application is organized into modules for clarity and scalability.

In the future, this system can be enhanced by integrating role-based login systems (e.g., for doctors, receptionists, and admins), email or SMS notifications for appointments, report export functionality, and analytics dashboards to track hospital performance. Additionally, making the design responsive would allow mobile device accessibility.

This project serves as a foundational step toward understanding how database-backed systems operate in real-world healthcare settings. It highlights the practical application of DBMS concepts in software development while addressing real-world problems in hospital administration.
